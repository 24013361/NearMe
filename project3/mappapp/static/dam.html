        <span style="font-size:200%;">T</span>he Idukki Dam is one of the most famous and important dams in Kerala. 
        It is built across the Periyar River and is known as one of the highest arch dams in Asia. 
        The dam stands between two massive hills called Kuravan and Kurathi, creating a breathtaking view 
        surrounded by green forests and misty mountains.

    <p style="font-size:30px; color:white;">
        Constructed in 1975, the dam plays a major role in generating hydroelectric power for the state. 
        It is part of the Idukki Hydroelectric Project and supplies electricity to a large portion of Kerala. 
        The structure itself is an engineering marvel and attracts thousands of tourists every year.

        During the monsoon season, when the shutters are opened, it becomes a spectacular sight to watch. 
        The calm reservoir, scenic surroundings, and cool climate make Idukki Dam not only a power source 
        but also a symbol of Kerala’s natural beauty and technological achievement.
